'''Write a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the
user. If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message
indicating that the entered letter is a vowel. If the user enters y then your program
should display a message indicating that sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is
a consonant. Otherwise your program should display a message indicating that the
letter is a consonant.'''
